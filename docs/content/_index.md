This project aims to create a Cargo plugin that creates semantic releases for Rust projects.

## Goals

- It can be installed as a Cargo plugin
- Works with Gitmoji commit messages
- Follows Semantic Versioning guidelines

## Installation

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
If you don't have, install the Rust toolchain.
{{< /callout >}}


Install the tool with `Cargo` with the following command.

```shell
cargo install cargo-semantic-release
```

This will globally install the `cargo-semantic-release` binary.

## Usage

You can run the tool in the directory of your choice via `Cargo` with the following command.

```shell
cargo semantic-release
```

This will print out the `major`, `minor`, `patch` related changes and the `other` changes.
Also, it will indicate the recommended action for the semantic version.

Example output:
```
Current directory: /home/RustroverProjects/cargo-semantic-release
Changes in the repository:
major:

minor:
        :sparkles: Evaluate the changes to define the action for semantic version
        :sparkles: Sort committed changes according to their impact
        :children_crossing: Show CI/CD badges in the README
        :sparkles: Create function to fetch commits from a repository
        :sparkles: Print out the commits in the directory where the program was called
        :heavy_plus_sign: Add git2 as dependency
        :sparkles: Print the path of the directory where the program was called
