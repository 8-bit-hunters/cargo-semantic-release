Thank you for your interest in this project!

ðŸš§ We are actively working on the tool to achieve similar level to other semantic-release tools.

Our inspiration are tools like:
- [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

We welcome all contributions, including bug fixes, new
features, documentation improvements, and discussions.
